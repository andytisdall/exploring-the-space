# Exploring the Space

Exploring the Space allows you to keep track of your musical recordings in an easy to navigate catalogue.

When writing, rehearsing, and recording demos of musical compositions, you may create many recordings to help keep track of your process. I found that existing music apps did not allow for me to keep track of the various demos and live recordings that I accumulated when working on a song. 

This web app has simple hierarchy that allows you to consolidate your recordings, so that you can document a certain performance or demo recording, and easily find it later.

If you want to know more about the nuts and bolts, there is a "How To" page on the site.
